# Claude Code Terminology for --parody Mode

Reference vocabulary for creating AI/LLM parody spinner verbs.

## Core Concepts

### Context & Memory
- **Context window** - The limited memory buffer ("running low on context")
- **Tokens** - Units of text ("burning through tokens")
- **Compaction** - Memory summarization ("compacting memories")
- **Summarization** - Condensing conversation history

### Agents & Execution
- **Sub-agent** - Spawned helper process ("spawning sub-agent")
- **Tool calls** - Actions Claude takes ("four tool calls!")
- **Parallel execution** - Running multiple tasks at once
- **Agentic loop** - The autonomous work cycle
- **Task tool** - Spawning specialized agents

### Communication
- **MCP server** - Model Context Protocol connection ("hailing MCP servers")
- **API calls** - External service requests
- **Hooks** - Event-triggered actions
- **Slash commands** - User-initiated commands ("/prosper")

### AI Behavior
- **Hallucinating** - Making things up ("hallucinating with precision")
- **Temperature** - Creativity/randomness setting
- **Guardrails** - Safety limits
- **Rate limits** - Usage restrictions ("shields at rate limit capacity")

### Development
- **Refactoring** - Code improvement ("phasers set to refactor")
- **Debugging** - Finding errors ("resistance is futile, so is debugging")
- **Prompt engineering** - Crafting instructions
- **Fine-tuning** - Model adjustment

### Claude Code Specific
- **Opus/Sonnet/Haiku** - Model tiers
- **Skills** - Loaded capabilities
- **Plugins** - Extension packages
- **Settings.json** - Configuration file
- **CLAUDE.md** - Project instructions

## Substitution Patterns

Use these mappings to convert theme-specific terms:

| Theme Term | Claude Code Equivalent |
|------------|------------------------|
| Ship/vessel | Context window, token buffer |
| Crew/team | Sub-agents, tools |
| Communications | MCP servers, API calls |
| Weapons | Tool calls, parallel execution |
| Shields | Rate limits, guardrails |
| Engineering | Prompt engineering, refactoring |
| Captain/leader | Main agent, orchestrator |
| Enemy/threat | Bugs, errors, exceptions |
| Power/energy | Tokens, credits, compute |
| Navigation | Codebase exploration |
| Sensors | Grep, glob, search tools |
| Logs | Conversation history, transcript |
| Mission | Task, user request |
| Warp speed | Fast execution, parallel mode |
| Coordinates | File paths, line numbers |

## Example Transformations

### Star Trek
- "Beam me up, Scotty" → "Beam me up, the context window is full"
- "Engage!" → "Spawning sub-agent. Engage!"
- "He's dead, Jim" → "The sub-agent is dead, Jim"
- "Hailing frequencies open" → "Hailing MCP servers, frequencies open"

### Game of Thrones
- "Winter is coming" → "Winter is coming... along with more tokens"
- "A Lannister always pays his debts" → "A Lannister always pays his API debts"
- "The night is dark and full of terrors" → "The codebase is dark and full of bugs"

### Mandalorian
- "This is the way" → "This is the way... to spawn a sub-agent"
- "I have spoken" → "I have spoken... to the MCP server"
- "Weapons are my religion" → "Tool calls are my religion"

## Humor Guidelines

1. **Keep it recognizable** - The original quote should still be obvious
2. **Make it relevant** - The AI term should fit naturally
3. **Don't force it** - If it doesn't work, skip that quote
4. **Vary the approach** - Mix substitutions, additions, and wordplay
5. **Stay tasteful** - Parody, not mockery
