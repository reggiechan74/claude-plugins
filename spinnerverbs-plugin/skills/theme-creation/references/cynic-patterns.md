# Cynic Patterns for --cynic Mode

Reference patterns for creating pessimistic/world-weary spinner verb variants.

## Core Tone

The cynic mode adds a layer of resigned humor, Murphy's Law observations, and self-deprecating commentary. The spinner verbs should feel like they're said by someone who has seen too much and expects things to go wrong.

## Guidelines

1. **Keep original meaning** - The cynicism adds flavor, not confusion
2. **Vary patterns** - Don't use "(sigh)" on everything
3. **Match theme tone** - Dark themes (GoT) can be darker; light themes stay lighter
4. **Be relatable** - The humor comes from shared frustration
5. **Avoid meanness** - Self-deprecating, not attacking others
